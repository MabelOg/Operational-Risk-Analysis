# Operational-Risk-Analysis
This project involved a comprehensive statistical analysis of operational risk loss data. Using data visualization and advanced statistical techniques (e.g., multicollinearity tests, t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD post hoc tests), it identified patterns and trends to inform risk management strategies across various time dimensions.
